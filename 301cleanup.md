# 301 cleanup

- all starter code
  - pass linter
  - strict mode
  - delete nav:hover rule from modules.css (articleView.toggleMenu should do it)
  - after hackerIpsum: rm `blogArticles.js`
  - after HBS: rm articleView.popfilters `if ($(this).hasClass(template))`
  - server: rm IIFE from GHProxy
  - leave express-request-proxy out of starter until needed
  - remove ref to /brookr/ from starter code

- class 01
  - double-check GH link to .eslintrc file for lab01 readme

- class 02
  - pair lab readme: forking/cloning instructions are really convoluted
